But, who is an SME?

A subject-matter expert (SME) is also known as a domain expert. It’s an individual with special skills or a deep understanding of a particular job or topic. An SME might be a software engineer, a helpdesk support operative, an accounts manager, a scientific researcher: in short, anybody with in-depth knowledge of the subject can become a subject-matter expert. 



An SME is considered an authority on a certain topic – not only educated on the subject but has the capacity to share their knowledge with other interested parties, in our case with technical writers.

However, many SMEs may not have time to provide constant feedback or may struggle to prioritize feedback due to a heavy workload or lack of time. 

A very good communication practice might be crucial, and that’s the thing most people either never heard or simply don’t care about.
