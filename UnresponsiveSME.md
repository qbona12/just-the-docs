But, who is an SME?

A subject-matter expert (SME) is also known as a domain expert. It’s an individual with special skills or a deep understanding of a particular job or topic. An SME might be a software engineer, a helpdesk support operative, an accounts manager, a scientific researcher: in short, anybody with in-depth knowledge of the subject can become a subject-matter expert. 



An SME is considered an authority on a certain topic – not only educated on the subject but has the capacity to share their knowledge with other interested parties, in our case with technical writers.
